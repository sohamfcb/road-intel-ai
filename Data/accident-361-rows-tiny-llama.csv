    '''Documentary Maker, 30, Killed In Collision Between 2 Bikes In Delhi: Cops Meanwhile, Pal's friend Sunny Bose alleged that Bunty's motorcycle hit the victim's bike from the rear. Delhi NewsPress Trust of IndiaUpdated: November 02, 2023 9:53 am IST Documentary Maker, 30, Killed In Collision Between 2 Bikes In Delhi: Cops Police said an FIR was registered against the offending bike rider (Representational) New Delhi: A 30-year-old documentary-maker was killed in a collision between two motorcycles near south Delhi's Panchsheel Enclave, police said on Wednesday. The incident occurred on Saturday at about 9.30 pm, they said, adding that Piyush Pal was rushed to a nearby hospital where he died during treatment on Tuesday. A call regarding the incident was received at Hauz Khas police station at 10.11 pm. When police reached the spot, the two motorcycle riders -- Pal and Bunty (26) -- were found to be shifted to different hospitals, a senior police officer said. The accident was captured on a nearby CCTV camera in which Pal's motorcycle is seen hitting a bike being driven by Bunty, who works as a driver in Gurugram. ""On the statement of Bunty and analysis of CCTV footage, an FIR was registered against the offending bike rider. But on Tuesday, around 6 pm, we got information about Pal's death,"" the officer said. Meanwhile, Pal's friend Sunny Bose alleged that Bunty's motorcycle hit the victim's bike from the rear. ""This is totally strange to know that the police registered a case against Piyush. We lost our friend who just celebrated his birthday two months ago on September 15,"" Mr Bose told news agency PTI. ""He was wearing an expensive helmet. He was the one who was lying in a pool of blood for more than 20 minutes. No one had come forward to help him. People gathered there just to click pictures and record videos, it was when a bike taxi aggregator along with three other men picked him up and rushed him to a nearby hospital,"" he said. Piyush was probably returning home from his swimming classes. His bike speed was normal when he was about to make a left turn, another bike hit him from the rear, Mr Bose alleged. ""The entire incident took place at about 9.30 pm. And people took him to the hospital after half an hour. His life could have been saved, if people helped him out on time,"" he said. ""Pal's mobile phone was ringing till 10 pm, but later it was showing off. A Go-Pro camera which he used to record video for his work purpose is also missing. We are not looking for any compensation from anyone, we only want justice,"" Bose said. ""Sunny was survived by his father, mother and a sister. His father has a shop at Chittaranjan Park market. His dream was to make a documentary on the life of crew members of Bollywood how they survive in Mumbai and their daily routine,"" he said. Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com The senior police officer said another FIR has been registered under sections 279 (rash driving) and 337 (causing hurt by an act which endangers human life, etc.) of the IPC against Bunty.'''[/INST]

Its occupants were brought back to Purulia town in West Bengal for medical treatment, a Trinamool party leader said. India NewsPress Trust of IndiaUpdated: October 01, 2023 6:09 pm IST Trinamool Protesters On Way To Delhi, Several Injured In Bus Accident The bus that was taking Trinamool protesters to Delhi Kolkata: Several Trinamool Congress workers were injured when one of the 49 buses taking them from West Bengal to Delhi to take part in a protest programme met with an accident in Jharkhand on Sunday. The bus careened and went down to a field behind the highway, leaving a few passengers slightly injured. Its occupants were brought back to Purulia town in West Bengal for medical treatment, a party leader said. The Trinamool asserted that as the Railways did not allot a special train, the party was taking 49 bus-load of protesters to Delhi to demand the state's dues from the BJP-led central government under the 100-day job guarantee programme under MGNREGA. Following the accident, senior West Bengal minister Shashi Panja accused the BJP of forcing the ruling party in Bengal to arrange buses as a special train was not allotted. ""Check your hands @Dr SukantaBJP, they're red with the blood of those injured,"" she wrote on X, formerly Twitter. First @BJP4India halted funds meant for the rural poor of Bengal! And then they cancelled the train that was supposed to carry the deprived beneficiaries to Delhi, forcing us to arrange for buses. Check your hands @DrSukantaBJP, they're red with the blood of those injured! https://t.co/sR0wsFz6La — Dr. Shashi Panja (@DrShashiPanja) October 1, 2023 BJP West Bengal president Sukanta Majumdar claimed that while TMC leaders were travelling by aeroplanes, the protesters were being made to take buses to Delhi. ""The way TMC leaders are enjoying the luxury of flights and pushed these innocent people to the brink of life risk is condemnable,"" he wrote on X. Trinamool MP Sougata Roy alleged that the ruling BJP at the Centre is trying to foil the TMC's protests by way of denial of train bookings and cancellations of flights. ""People of the country should see how the BJP is trying to thwart our programme,"" he told reporters. The Eastern Railway has contended that it received the request from the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) and the unavailability of rakes was the reason behind denial of the special train.

Trinamool MP Abhishek Banerjee asserted on Saturday that the TMC cannot be scared off from its political programmes through summons by central agencies, and vowed to go ahead with the protests in Delhi. The Diamond Harbour MP has been summoned by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on October 3 in connection with its ongoing investigation into the alleged school jobs scam.

    '''Kuber Group Director Among Injured In High-Speed Rolls-Royce Crash Near Delhi: Cop Two of the three people in a petrol tanker were killed when the Rolls-Royce Phantom had rammed it on the New Delhi-Mumbai expressway in Haryana's Nuh on Tuesday. India NewsReported by Parimal Kumar, Edited by Rohit PaulUpdated: August 25, 2023 9:43 pm IST Mr Vikas Malu is undergoing treatment at a hospital in Gurugram. New Delhi: In a big revelation, a senior police official has confirmed that industrialist and Kuber Group director Vikas Malu was among the three occupants of the Rolls-Royce that smashed into a petrol tanker at a high speed. Mr Malu is undergoing treatment at a hospital in Gurugram. Two of the three people in the tanker - the driver and his assistant - were killed when the Rolls-Royce Phantom had rammed it on the New Delhi-Mumbai expressway in Nuh on Tuesday. Barring the driver, all of the car's occupants had been hospitalised. Speaking exclusively to NDTV, Nuh Superintendent of Police Narendra Bijaraniya said an FIR has been registered at the Nagina police station and an investigation is on. Mr Bijaraniya was then asked this question: ""What is the condition of Vikas Malu, who was in the Rolls-Royce?"" The officer replied that he is currently admitted to Medanta hospital in Gurugram and is undergoing treatment. Asked whether Mr Malu was out of danger, Mr Bijaraniya said only doctors would be able to comment on that. Another question posed to the officer was whether this was the same Vikas Malu who is a big industrialist and is associated with the Kuber Group. Mr Bijaraniya replied in the affirmative. The SP said the Rolls-Royce's driver has been asked to join the investigation and the other occupant of the car, who is undergoing treatment with Mr Malu at Medanta hospital, will also be asked to do so once he is discharged. Mr Malu's statement will be recorded after the hospital discharges him. Stating that the entire stretch of the expressway is covered with CCTV cameras, the officer said the police are scanning the footage. He said the truck had taken a U-turn on the highway and the Phantom was travelling at a very high speed when the accident took place. He added that the details of the car's exact speed will be available only after a scientific examination. Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com NDTV also tracked down the third occupant of the tanker, Gautam, who is recovering from his injuries at his house in Haryana's Ujina. Gautam, who was sitting next to the driver and the assistant, said the truck was taking a U-turn when it was rammed by the Rolls-Royce. Struggling to speak because of his injuries, he said the Phantom's speed was at least 190 km/hr and the truck overturned after being hit. He claimed the car driver was at fault.'''[/INST]

    '''Pregnant Wife Killed In Accident, Man Gets ""Loss Of Foetus"" Compensation Justice Navin Chawla said the husband of the deceased ""lost his entire family in the accident, including the child whom he could never see"". India NewsPress Trust of IndiaUpdated: August 17, 2023 12:23 am IST Pregnant Wife Killed In Accident, Man Gets 'Loss Of Foetus' Compensation The Delhi court opined that the husband was entitled to a ""just"" compensation. (File) New Delhi: The Delhi High Court has awarded ₹ 5 lakh as compensation to a man who lost his 27-year-old pregnant wife, a police constable, in a road accident, saying he is entitled to the amount for the ""loss of the foetus"" carried by the woman. Justice Navin Chawla said a foetus is another life in a woman and its loss is actually a loss of a child in the offing and the husband of the deceased ""lost his entire family in the accident, including the child whom he could never see"". The Uttar Pradesh Police constable died in July 2013 as a result of injuries she suffered after a truck at high speed hit a motorcycle on which she was riding with her colleague from behind. The constable was riding pillion. The court opined that the husband was entitled to a ""just"" compensation. Stating that the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal's decision to give a compensation of ₹ 2.5 lakh for loss of the eight-month-old foetus was not adequate, the judge directed that an enhanced compensation of ₹ 5 lakh be given by the insurer. ""There can be no doubt that the appellant herein is entitled to compensation that may be found 'just' for the loss of the foetus carried by the deceased at the time of the accident/her death,"" the court said in a recent order. ""Keeping in view the facts of the present case, I find the compensation of ₹ 2,50,000 awarded by the learned tribunal to be inadequate. The same shall stand enhanced to ₹ 5,00,000,"" the judge ordered.

The tribunal had held that the constable died due to the negligent driving and awarded compensation to the husband on the basis of the ""loss of estate at 1/3rd of the income of the deceased"". It had further also awarded a sum of ₹ 2.50 lakh towards the death of the foetus. Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com The appellant argued before the high court that the tribunal erred in restricting the compensation towards the death of the foetus only to ₹ 2.50 lakh as he was expecting his first child with his deceased wife and his entire family ""wiped-out"" in the accident.'''[/INST]

    '''Delhi Boy Dies In Accident, 3 Friends Dump His Body, Avoid Hospital: Cops The Delhi Police said on Monday that the three accused instead of taking the injured Nitesh to a hospital dumped him at an underpass, due to which he died. India NewsAsian News InternationalUpdated: March 14, 2023 3:25 pm IST Delhi Boy Dies In Accident, 3 Friends Dump His Body, Avoid Hospital: Cops The auto met with an accident in the Nand Nagri area and overturned. (Representational) New Delhi: Three accused including a minor were arrested for allegedly dumping their friend, who was critically injured after they met with an accident, at an underpass in the Vivek Vihar area, police said. The boy has been identified as Nitesh. The Delhi Police said on Monday that the three accused instead of taking the injured Nitesh to a hospital dumped him at an underpass, due to which he died. As per the police, the four friends had gone for an auto ride after the Holi Dahan party on the intervening night of March 7-8. The auto belonged to one of the friends named Pawan, who was driving the vehicle. The auto met with an accident in the Nand Nagri area and overturned. The accident left Nitesh injured. Instead of taking him to a hospital, the three of them took him from the spot in the same auto and dumped him in an underpass in the Vivek Vihar area. Because of not getting treatment on time, the injured succumbed to his injuries, the police said. On March 8, the police received information about a body being found in the Vivek Vihar area and started an investigation. While scanning through the CCTV footage, the police saw the footage of the three accused dumping the boy near the underpass. Based on the inputs and further investigation, the police ultimately nabbed the three accused. While the two accused namely Pawan and Brij Mohan have been arrested, another minor accused has been detained, the police said. The police have registered cases under sections 304, 201 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Talking to ANI, the victim's father Rajendra Gupta expressed doubt on the case being that of merely an accident and alleged that his son was murdered. ""Nitesh had gone to the Holika Dahan party on the evening of March 7 and then did not return, we tried to find him a lot. His friends had taken him for the ride. It was only three days later on March 10, that we came to know that Nitesh had died. The police told us that his body was found at the underpass. We have performed the last rites of Nitesh after the post-mortem on March 11,"" he said. The boy's sister Baby Gupta also alleged the involvement of Nitesh's friends in his death and demanded justice. ""One of the arrested accused met us on March 8, but even then he didn't tell us about the accident. On being asked, he said that he doesn't know where Nitesh is. My marriage is slated to happen next month, and Nitesh had done a lot of preparations regarding that. He was the only brother among the six sisters. My father is sick and works as a fruit vendor. Nitesh was our support but he is no longer with us. I suspect that something wrong happened with Nitesh. We want justice, and the culprits should be severely punished,"" she said.'''[/INST]

    '''Delhi Bus Crashes Into Cemetary, Damages Wall The incident occurred on Saturday morning at 6:50 am, police said. Delhi NewsAsian News InternationalUpdated: March 04, 2023 10:21 pm IST The accident damaged 10-12 graves. New Delhi: A cluster bus crashed through the wall of a cemetery in central Delhi's Khan Market area Saturday morning and damaged around 10 graves, police said. Videos and pictures of the accident, widely circulated on social media, showed a major part of the bus inside the boundary of the cemetery. Police said the cluster bus was coming from Humayun Road and the driver lost control while taking a left turn and rammed the cemetery wall. They said it was going for duty from the Jawaharlal Nehru stadium to Karampura for route number 408 and at the time, there were only three people on board - the driver conductor and the marshal. The driver has been identified as Sanjay Kumar. A case under section 279 (rash driving) has been registered and further investigation was carried out, police said. Cluster buses are monitored and managed by the Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System Limited (DIMTS). Quoting the driver, a DIMTS official said around 6.36 am, while negotiating the roundabout near Hotel Taj Mann Sing after Khan Market, the bus crashed into the cemetery wall while attempting to avoid collision with a car coming from the right side at very high speed. The speed of the bus at that time was 30 kilometres per hour. Eugene Ratnam, secretary of the Delhi Cemeteries Committee, said the accident damaged 10-12 graves. ""There are two caretakers who live with their families inside the premises. They live on opposite sides of the cemetery. They heard a loud noise and saw the bus inside the cemetery after tearing down a portion of the wall. They immediately informed us about the incident,"" he said. ""Some families have come to check the damage to the graves,"" Mr Ratnam said, adding the committee will help clean the cemetery and repair the graves. Last month, a DTC bus hit a car before ramming into a subway crossing in west Delhi's Naraina area. Three people -- the driver, conductor and the marshal deployed on the bus -- were injured in that accident. Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com The bus was going towards the Naraina depot after dropping all the passengers at the stop. The driver later told the police that the braking system of the bus had failed.'''[/INST]

    '''One Dead, Over a Dozen Injured In Noida After Fog Causes Collision The blanket of fog also affected traffic movement in Delhi and prompted airport authorities to launch a low visibility action plan. Noida NewsReported by Mukesh Singh Sengar, Edited by Anisha PrakashUpdated: December 20, 2022 11:35 am IST One Dead, Over a Dozen Injured In Noida After Fog Causes Collision This is the second accident on the Eastern Peripheral Highway in two days. New Delhi: One person died and 14 others were injured when a bus with 60 passengers overturned on the Delhi-Jhansi expressway, reportedly due to dense fog that enveloped several parts of north India this morning. The accident took placed near Galgotia University on the Eastern Peripheral Highway stretch between Agra and Noida. The bus crashed into a container that had stopped abruptly. The highway reportedly had visibility of less than 50 metres due to the thick layer of fog. Police reached the spot soon after the accident and started a rescue operation. Those injured in the accident were rushed to a hospital, where one passenger died during treatment. In the aftermath of the accident, questions have been raised on the administration's measures to prevent such incidents. The absence of reflective road signs is being cited as one of the reasons for drivers failing to control vehicles in foggy conditions. The blanket of fog also affected traffic movement in Delhi and prompted airport authorities to launch a low visibility action plan. A video shot by a traveller before boarding a plane shows poor visibility on the tarmac. The Delhi Airport, in an earlier morning tweet, cautioned passengers while assuring that flight operations have not been affected yet. ""Low Visibility Procedures are in progress at Delhi Airport. All flight operations are presently normal. Passengers are requested to contact the airline concerned for updated flight information,"" the tweet read.

Delhi NewsPress Trust of IndiaUpdated: December 13, 2022 6:28 pm IST 2 Class 9 Students Going To Tuition Killed After Car Hits Them In Delhi The car driver has been arrested, the police said. (Representational) New Delhi: Two students of class 9 died after being hit by a car while they were crossing the Rohtak Road here, police said on Tuesday. The car driver has been arrested, they said. The students, Vanshika Mishra and Manvi were both aged 14 and studied in Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya in Peeragarhi village, police said. According to police, the accident took place on Sunday when both the girls were going for tuition in Peeragarhi village around 4 pm. While they were crossing the Rohtak Road (Nangloi to Peeragarhi carriage way) at Metro Pillar no.294, they were hit by a car that was being driven by Arun Sharma, resident of Nangloi. Sharma along with his father Ravi was going to Karnal bypass to collect a water tank for hospital machines of Sant Onkar Singh Memorial Charitable Hospital, police said. The injured girls were taken to Pushpanjali Hospital and later referred to Balaji Action hospital where Manvi was declared dead and due to non-availability of ventilator, Mishra was hospitalised in Maharaja Agrasen Hospital but died during treatment, a senior police officer said. Both the bodies have been handed over to their respective families after post-mortem, he said. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Outer) Harendra Kumar Singh said a case has been registered under section 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way), 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 304 (punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the Indian Penal Code and the accused driver was arrested. The accused was not drunk at the time of the accident, the senior police officer said. After the death of Manvi, the SHO of Paschim Vihar met with the Pradhan and other members of the locality and condoled with the family of the victims, police said. However, around 9.30 am on Monday, a group of nearly 300 people to the victims' locality started to move towards the residence of MLA Shri Raghuvinder Shaukin and arrived on a service road near Ring Road. They met the MLA and sought to know why the foot overbridge was not constructed even after assurance given by him five months ago. They also demanded that proper traffic signal lights be installed at pillar no.294 with a zebra crossing. Police said Mishra's father works as a peon with a chartered accountant while Manvi's father is a farmer and resides at his native place in Bijnor.'''[/INST]

New Delhi: A 27-year-old Delhi man has been arrested for rash driving which resulted in the death of two children and seriously injured several others early morning last Friday. Sahil Narang, a resident of Nirman Vihar in Delhi, rammed his BMW luxury car at high speed into a Wagon R which then flipped over and crashed into people sleeping on the footpath under the Lodhi Road flyover, police said.

    '''Zomato Delivery Exec Among 3 Dead After Grisly Car-Bike Crash In Delhi Visuals from the spot show the mangled frames of the overturned hatchback car and the two-wheeler. Delhi NewsReported by Mukesh Singh Sengar, Edited by Saikat Kumar BoseUpdated: May 01, 2022 10:32 am IST Seven people were in the car at the time of the accident New Delhi: A Zomato delivery partner and two teenagers died after a motorbike and a car crashed in north-east Delhi's Shakarpur area last night. According to police, the young women and five others of their family were returning from Peeragarhi in west Delhi to their home in Karkardooma. While three people were sitting in the front, four were at the back. When the car was passing through Laxmi Nagar, the Zomato delivery partner on the bike came in the way and the car's driver lost control as he was trying to steer clear, it is learnt. Those stuck inside the overturned car were pulled out and rushed to a hospital where Jyoti, 17, and Bharti, 19, were declared dead. Two others have suffered minor injuries. Visuals from the spot show the mangled frames of the hatchback car and the two-wheeler. Police said the Zomato delivery partner is yet to be identified. According to local residents, the man was seriously injured after the accident and was rushed to a nearby hospital. Hospital authorities, they said, told them that no bed was available and as they were trying to arrange a bed, the delivery partner died. Police have registered a case and further investigation is on. The accident comes a month after Zomato launched a 10-minute food delivery feature, prompting concerns about rash driving and safety of delivery partners. Seeking to allay the fears, Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal had then said that the 10-minute delivery feature will only be available in specific locations and that the delivery executives will be unaware of the promised delivery time. He had claimed that this service will be as safe for the delivery partners as its 30-minute delivery feature.'''[/INST]

    '''Swiggy Delivery Partners Catch Driver Who Fled Scene Of Accident Prashansa Rana shared her story on LinkedIn, saying that she and her friends were driving from Indirapuram in Ghaziabad on Sunday night when they met with an accident. OffbeatWritten by Sanya JainUpdated: April 01, 2021 10:54 am IST Swiggy Delivery Partners Catch Driver Who Fled Scene Of Accident Swiggy delivery partners came to the aid of a group that met with an accident. (Representative Image) 4 A Delhi woman has shared a post of appreciation for Swiggy delivery partners who helped her and her friends after they met with a road accident. Prashansa Rana shared her story on LinkedIn, saying that she and her friends were driving from Indirapuram in Ghaziabad on Sunday night when they met with an accident. The driver who hit them fled the scene of the accident even as the occupants of Ms Rana's car were left injured in the middle of the road. ""The only thing I could take was the car number,"" she wrote. ""In this panic, a guy came and took my friend on his bike to follow the car."" ""Meanwhile, we were in the middle of road with bruises and a broken car."" In her LinkedIn post, Ms Rana said that four to five Swiggy delivery guys came to their aid. They helped her park the car and offered her a phone to call emergency services as her own phone had broken during the accident. Meanwhile, Ms Rana's friend had no success in tracking down the driver who hit them and returned after an unsuccessful chase. But just as they were preparing to leave, the delivery men informed her that their fellow delivery guys had managed to catch the driver near Vaishali, about five kilometres away. Prashansa Rana, along with her friends and the delivery guys, reached Vaishali, where they were met with an ""overwhelming"" sight. ""There were 30 to 35 Swiggy delivery boys not allowing that car and driver to move,"" she recounted in her post, adding that because of the delivery guys, she was able to recover damage costs from the driver. When she thanked the delivery guys for their help, they only told her to pay it forward. ""This generosity needs no education, no degree and no highly paid jobs but ethics, morality, humanity and kindness,"" wrote Ms Rana. ""@swiggy delivery guys, you guys are real heroes! take my bow!""'''[/INST]

    '''Post-Mortem Confirms Farmer Died Of Tractor Accident Injuries: UP Police The man, identified as Navrit Singh from Rampur, around 180 km from the national capital, had recently returned to his native village from Australia, where his wife is a student. India NewsReported by Alok Pandey, Edited by Vaibhav Tiwari (with inputs from Agencies)Updated: January 27, 2021 6:29 pm IST Post-Mortem Confirms Farmer Died Of Tractor Accident Injuries: UP Police Tractor Rally: Over 300 personnel were injured in Tuesday's violence (File) Lucknow: A farmer from Uttar Pradesh who died in Delhi's ITO area while participating in Tuesday's tractor rally that descended into violence and chaos, was not shot as claimed by some of his fellow protesters yesterday, the UP police said today. The 26-year-old man's post-mortem examination has confirmed that he died from injuries received in a tractor accident, police added. ""The post-mortem report clarifies that he was not shot. He died of the antemortem injuries which he received after his tractor overturned as seen in a viral video,"" Avinash Chandra, a senior UP police officer, was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. CCTV footage of the incident released yesterday showed the man driving a blue tractor towards police barricades as apparently the rattled security personnel brace for impact. The speeding tractor, in an attempt to break through the cordon, rams the barricades and overturns. While the Delhi police had said yesterday that he died because of the accident injuries, some protesters had claimed he was shot dead. The man, identified as Navrit Singh from Rampur, around 180 km from the national capital, had recently returned to his native village from Australia, where his wife is a student. He had joined the farmers' protest against the three central agriculture laws on Tuesday. ""We came together to participate in the parade but never knew it would happen,"" a neighbour told news agency PTI. The tractor rally was called by an umbrella body of 40 farmers' unions to press for their demand for repeal of the three laws. The rally, as agreed by the unions, was to begin at around 11.30 AM and pass through the outskirts of Delhi. Thousands of farmers on tractors and other vehicles, however, had begun pushing into the national capital through unplanned routes by 8 AM, knocking down barricades and clashing with the police. The farmers, who had been trying to get to the iconic Red Fort in central Delhi, were stopped by the police at ITO. By noon, hundreds of the protesters had reached the Red Fort. A protester also hoisted a religious flag at a flagpole on the ramparts of the monument, triggering outrage. Over 300 personnel were injured in Tuesday's violence and 22 cases have been registered, police said today. Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com The farmers' unions have distanced themselves from the violence and alleged a conspiracy to ""torpedo"" their peaceful movement.'''[/INST]

    '''On Camera, Accident That Left A Farmer Dead During Protests The farmer has been identified as Navdeep Singh Hundal, a 26-year-old from Uttarakhand's Bajpur area, who recently got married, according to his fellow farmers India NewsReported by Sunil Prabhu, Edited by Chandrashekar Srinivasan (with inputs from PTI)Updated: January 26, 2021 7:34 pm IST Farmers and police clashed in unprecedented scenes in Delhi on Republic Day New Delhi: One farmer died after a speeding tractor overturned near the ITO junction in central Delhi, the police said Tuesday, amid clashes with farmers taking out a rally to protest the centre's new agriculture laws. CCTV footage of the incident showed a blue tractor crashing through yellow Delhi Police barricades at high speed before rolling over twice and coming to rest by the side of the road. However, some farmers at the site - near the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Marg - claimed he was killed in police firing and began a sit-in protest. The farmer has been identified as Navdeep Singh Hundal, 26, from Uttarakhand's Bajpur area. Two other farmers, Angrez Singh and his son from a village in Uttarakhand's Rudrapur, told NDTV Navdeep Singh had recently been married. ""This boy.. his name is Navneet Singh. He was driving the tractor... he was injured by a police bullet and died on the spot,"" Angrez Singh said. Late in the afternoon farmers finally allowed Navdeep Singh's body to be removed. The tractor was part of a group from the Ghazipur border that had taken a detour from the agreed upon route for Tuesday's rally, a senior police officer told news agency PTI. The ITO area saw fierce clashes between farmers and police. A police bus was also hijacked and the cops resorted to lathi charges and firing tear gas shells to control the situation. In the evening a tense stand-off ensued between a group of protesters and a large contingent of security forces, including police, CRPF (Central Reserve Police Force) and RAF (Rapid Action Force). Earlier in the day two farmers were injured after another tractor - which was also speeding - overturned near the Chilla border that separates Delhi and Noida.

The farmers had been given permission to take out their tractor rally after the annual parade at Rajpath, the iconic boulevard at the heart of the city, and along pre-designated routes. But crowds swelled at the borders at around 8 am - even before the parade started, and hundreds of farmers forced open the police barricades and marched into the city. As the day progressed groups of farmers broke from agreed routes and clashed violently with cops. Some cops were injured trying to stop the protesters, who were tear-gassed and baton-charged. By the afternoon, a group of farmers drove their tractors into the Red Fort complex, where protesters gained access to the outer courtyards and ramparts of the iconic Mughal-era fort. Visuals showed farmers hoisting a sacred flag of Sikhs at an empty second flagpole. The farmers have blamed ""anti-social elements"" for the violence and the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a federation of 40 farmer unions, has dissociated itself from the chaos and appealed for calm.'''[/INST]

    '''Delhi High Court Says Parents Of Road Accident Victim Entitled To Compensation The high court's observations came while awarding compensation for loss of dependency to a woman, who lost her 23-year-old son in a road accident in 2008, and enhanced the award amount from ₹ 2.42 lakh to ₹ 6.80 lakh. Delhi NewsPress Trust of IndiaUpdated: January 17, 2021 4:01 pm IST Delhi High Court Says Parents Of Road Accident Victim Entitled To Compensation The Delhi high court said parents are considered in law as dependent on their children. (File) New Delhi: Parents are dependent on their children at some stage of life and it would be inequitable to deny compensation to those who lost their ward in a road accident, the Delhi High Court has said. Justice JR Midha said even if parents are not dependent on their children at the time of an accident, they will certainly be dependent, both financially and emotionally, upon them at the later stage of their life, as the children were dependent upon their parents in their initial years. The high court's observations came while awarding compensation for loss of dependency to a woman, who lost her 23-year-old son in a road accident in 2008, and enhanced the award amount from ₹ 2.42 lakh to ₹ 6.80 lakh. The motor accident claims tribunal had held that though the accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle, the parents of the victim were not entitled to compensation for loss of dependency but only to compensation for loss of the estate. It had held that the victim's father was working with the Delhi Police as a Sub-Inspector and was, therefore, not dependent upon his son. It had also said that his mother cannot be said to be dependent upon the victim as her husband was employed with the Delhi Police. The high court, however, said it was of the view that parents are considered in law as dependent on their children, considering that they are bound to support their parents in their old age, when the parents would be unable to maintain themselves. The court, which said the law imposes a responsibility on the children to maintain their parents, added that ""it would therefore be unfair as well as inequitable to deny compensation for loss of dependency to a parent, who may not be dependent on his/her child at the time of accident per se but would become dependent at him or her later age"". It further said that provisions of Code of Criminal Procedure, Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act and Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act cast an obligation on the children to maintain their parents and these legislations recognise the legal rights of parents to be maintained by their children. Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com The high court directed that a copy of this judgement be sent to the Registrar General who shall circulate it to all Motor Accident Claims Tribunals to note that the principles relating to the loss to the estate in Keith Rowe judgement and Dinesh Adhlak judgement are not applicable to the claim of the parents in respect of the death of their child, claim of children in respect of death of their parents and claim of a spouse in respect of death of his/her spouse in a motor accident. Post a comment It said the copy of this judgement be also sent to Delhi Judicial Academy to sensitise the claims tribunals about the principles laid down by this court in this verdict.'''[/INST]

    '''₹ 75 Lakh Compensation For Delhi Man After Accident Due To Barricades The victim was admitted at a hospital in Delhi and after undergoing multiple surgeries and treatment, he was discharged in a state of unconsciousness. India NewsPress Trust of IndiaUpdated: May 20, 2020 12:22 am IST Rs 75 Lakh Compensation For Delhi Man After Accident Due To Barricades Court noted the barricades were neither properly lighted nor blinkers were put on (Representational) New Delhi: The Delhi High Court has directed the Delhi Police to pay a compensation of ₹ 75 lakh to a youth, who is in a severe state after being met with an accident due to the chained barricades kept on a road in Delhi. The court held the victim was entitled to the claim of damages for the negligence and failure of the Delhi Police to discharge its duty. Justice Navin Chawla noted that the barricades were neither properly lighted nor adequate reflectors or blinkers were put on them to make them visible from a long distance. The court awarded ₹ 75 lakh compensation to petitioner Dheeraj Kumar, who was 21-year-old at the time of the incident in December 2015. The accident took place on an early December morning when Dheeraj Kumar and his father were returning home on a motorcycle and collided with police barricades which were chained together so as to cordon off a road/ street completely. The victim was admitted at a hospital in Delhi and after undergoing multiple surgeries and treatment, he was discharged in a state of unconsciousness. The court was informed that as per the discharge summary record, he was in a state of ""altered sensorium, eye opening to pain, not opening to commands"" and since then, his condition has not changed. The youth and his father approached the court seeking compensation towards the refund of medical expenses, loss of income/dependency, loss of prospects, continuing future needs as also for the pain and suffering suffered due to the accident. The court, in its verdict, said the barricades were chained and therefore, did not allow vehicles to pass through and such chains could not have been visible to the motorist from a distance. ""They were also unmanned. Merely because no helmet was shown to have been recovered from the site, cannot lead to a conclusion that the petitioner no.1 (Kumar) was not wearing a helmet at the time of the accident or was driving his motorcycle at a high speed or rashly."" ""It is not disputed that no one was present at the site of the accident at the time of the accident. In any case, the petitioners (Kumar and his father) are held entitled to their claim of damages for the negligence and failure of the respondent no.2 (Delhi Police) to discharge its duty…,"" the court said. ""Keeping in view all the facts and circumstances of the case and the law relating to award of compensation, a total compensation of ₹ 75 lakhs was found to be just and payable to the petitioners by the Delhi Police,"" the court said and directed the police to deposit the amount with the registrar general of the high court within four weeks. The police, in its response, contended that the accident took place due to contributory negligence of Dheeraj Kumar as he was speeding and was unable to brake in time to avoid colliding with the barricades.'''[/INST]

    '''About ten persons were injured when a private bus taking people back from Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde's Dussehra rally in Mumbai met with an accident in Thane district, the police said on Wednesday. The accident occurred around 12.30 midnight on the Kolambe bridge on the Mumbai-Nashik highway near Shahapur, PTI reported. A truck rammed into the bus from the rear side pushing it onto the divider. In the meanwhile, another bus hit the truck from behind and overturned due to the impact. The first bus was carrying about 20 people, who were returning after attending CM Shinde's rally in Mumbai, said an official from Thane rural police control room. It was going towards Sillod in Nashik district, he said. The injured were taken to a local government hospital for treatment, said the official from Thane police's rural control room. Shinde on Tuesday addressed thousands of people at the Shiv Sena's Dussehra rally at Azad Maidan in Mumbai. His rival and Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray held his party's annual rally at Shivaji Park. Launching a blistering attack on Uddhav Thackeray CM Shinde said he buried the Hindutva ideology of Bal Thackeray for power and joined hands with Congress and socialist parties. Shinde, without naming Thackeray, said he back-stabbed Bal Thackeray by committing dishonesty with his ideological legacy. Shinde also said he won't be surprised if they (Shiv Sena-UBT) ally with Asaduddin Owaisi-led AIMIM and even ""hug terrorist organisations such as Hamas, Hizbul Mujahideen, Lashkar-e-Toiba for their selfish motives and chair (power)"". He also reiterated that the state government is committed to granting quota to Maraths which will stand the legal scrutiny and appealed to youths not to take extreme steps like committing suicide. ""You have buried the Hindutva ideology of Balasaheb Thackeray by going with Congress and Samajwadis for power. Balasaheb had given 'Garv se kaho hum Hindu hai' slogan from 'Shivtirth' (Shivaji Park ground) but slogans like 'Garv se kaho hum Congressi and Sama'''[/INST]

    '''An elderly man narrowly escaped death after being knocked down by a bus while crossing the road. The incident took place in Powai area of Mumbai. The footage has been captured on the CCTV installed in the area and posted by news agency ANI on Twitter. It shows the man dressed in kurta-pyjama trying to cross a road in the locality when a bus knocks him down from one side. The incident horrified the pedestrians who watched on as the man appeared from under the bus unhurt. It took place on Tuesday outside the Everest Heights Building near the Lake Side complex. A number of users have also posted the clip on Twitter and other social media platforms. The 47-second video begins with showing a busy street in the Powai area, with lots of cars and autorickshaws crossing the street. A bus too is seen stuck on one side of the road due to traffic. A few seconds later, an elderly man appears in the camera frame and tries to cross the road. But looking at the traffic flow, stops after taking a few steps. But the bus driver, unaware of the man standing in front of the vehicle, races ahead knocking him down. The man is seen going under the bus and other car drivers shouting. The bus driver immediately halts the vehicle and opens the door to check if the man is alive. Miraculously, the elderly man appears from behind the bus unscathed and is seen walking towards the driver at the end of the video.'''[/INST]

The driver of the car was busy charging his mobile, when his friend - an auto driver - started the car. The car was seen knocking down a person before coming to a halt. In the next frame, passersby were seen rushing to help the injured man. Around seven people sustained minor injuries, said police, adding the driver has been arrested. Delhi and Mumbai don't look so different when it comes to road accidents, a study by insurance provider ACKO has found. The national capital is the most road accident-prone region in the country with an accident rate of 20.3 per cent while Mumbai stood a close second at 18.2 per cent, according to the ACKO accident index.'''[/INST]

    '''New Delhi/Mumbai: Sixteen people have been killed overnight in two rain-related accidents in Mumbai and the neighbouring city of Thane as the city witnessed heavy rain overnight. Several suburban and long-distance trains have been cancelled after railway tracks were flooded. The Maharashtra government has declared a public holiday today in Mumbai as a precautionary measure following the incessant rain and has asked people to stay indoors. 54 flights have been diverted as the main runway of the Mumbai airport was closed last night after a SpiceJet plane overshot the runway last night while landing. The plane is still stuck on the runway. A runway one is being used for flight operations. The city received the highest rainfall in a decade over a two-day period since Sunday, resulting in massive traffic jams and flooding homes in low-lying areas. ""Due to heavy rain forecast in Mumbai even today by IMD, People are advised to stay indoors unless there is any emergency,"" Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis's office tweeted. The state government said that only emergency services will remain functional in Mumbai today. ""It's nature's fury... Moving trains in such rains in Kurla Thane section is safety hazard at this point of time... Suburban Train movement has been suspended till further advice. Inconvenience is deeply regretted,"" Central Railway tweeted minutes after midnight on Tuesday. But this morning, Western and Central Railway have been tweeting updates of train lines that are functional. Passengers of three suburban trains who got stuck on flooded tracks were evacuated by Railway Protection Force (RPF) staff, Central Railway tweeted. Thirteen people were killed and four critically injured after a compound wall crashed in Mumbai's Malad East early this morning. Officials fear that three to five persons may be trapped in debris. In neighbouring Thane's Kalyan, three, including a three-year-old boy, have been killed after the wall of a school crashed on two houses. The government has announced a compensation of ₹ 5 lakh'''[/INST]

    '''Mumbai: While the people of Mumbai were sleeping on Saturday night, a dangerous midnight car chase was unfolding on Reay Road in south Mumbai after the driver of a BMW luxury sedan hit some people and sped away. Two of several people hit by the sedan have been admitted to hospital, the police said. On getting information about the accident at 12:30 am, the police said they sent an interceptor vehicle that soon managed to tail the BMW sedan but could not quite catch up as the powerful car was speeding. Some motorists who had seen the car hit the pedestrians joined the police in the chase. The BMW sedan sprinted at a very high speed for 4 km before it was cornered, the police said. The motorists who have been chasing the car managed to pull out the driver and some locals who were at the spot beat him up before he was handed over to the police. The locals also broke the car's windshield and dented the BMW sedan with blows using heavy sticks. The driver, Mehmood Alam, was drink driving, a police officer said, news agency ANI reported. The owner of the BWM car had left for Dubai a day ago and handed the car key to Mr Alam, the police said. The police said they are taking statements of eyewitnesses and a complaint will be filed.'''[/INST]

The two were crossing the road at Worli Sea Face around 9.30 pm on Saturday when the motorcycle hit them. One of the three people on the vehicle has also been severely injured, while the other two are absconding. Girija, a resident of Mahim who was studying transport management, was crossing the road with Kunal when the accident occurred. Shivendra Vaidya, Kunal's father, said, ""When the bike hit Girija, her clothes got trapped in the wheels and she was dragged for 100 m during which her head continuously hit the divider that broke her skull."" Rakesh Singh, a driver who was passing the area with his employer, rushed her to Lilavati Hospital. Singh said, ""I saw a speeding biker ram into the girl who was crossing the road. On seeing her condition, my boss asked me to take her to hospital. I drove as fast as I could..."" Kunal has said there were three people on the bike. Girija succumbed to her injuries on Sunday. Ganga Murli Ambala, her father, told mid-day, ""She was a very bright student and we were preparing for her 20th birthday, on February 1. People should be cautious while driving. Those who have done this to my daughter deserve maximum punishment."" Girija's family wanted to donate her organs after she was pronounced brain dead. ""But the doctors monitoring her situation said they would not be using her organs as she has lost too much blood,"" her father said. The police said one of the three on the bike has also been injured and is in the ICU at Sushrut hospital in Mahim, while the other two are absconding, ever since they left the bike on the road following the mishap. The Worli police have registered an FIR against them.

    '''In the wake of the bus mishap on Saturday, the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) has decided to put a height barrier at the junction of the common stretch of the Mumbai-Pune Expressway and the old Mumbai-Pune highway. This is to prevent movement of heavy vehicles on the 'S' shaped stretch of the old Mumbai-Pune highway, said Raigad superintendent of police Somnath Gharge.The driver of the bus that crashed had taken the wrong turn to get on to that stretch, and many other drivers have also been taking the turn though it is a hazardous one. The 'wrong turn' road is a high gradient area infamous for mishaps and is known as a black spot. The area is also a tourist spot with the Shingroba temple nearby. The stretch often attracts tourists, with a large number of small and big waterfalls seen there during the rainy season.Following media reports, the entry had been closed by dumping mud around four years ago. But the locals opposed it. The road has a number of u-turns, and drivers use it to save about two kms and toll tax by taking the old Mumbai-Pune highway through the Shedung toll plaza, often unaware of the risks involved. Khopoli resident and owner of a hospital, Dr Ranjit Mohite, said, ""We have been trying for the past several years to stop wrong entry, but to no avail. Frequent accidents have been claiming lives and injuring many. The entry should be stopped at any cost."" Gharge said, ""The major cause of mishaps here is not only wrong entry but also speeding, loss of control, dozing off by the driver. The road portion is not technically fit in terms of its gradient and 'S' shape for heavy vehicles. MSRDC had put signboards earlier. The locals are pressurising us to keep this stretch open.""'''[/INST]

    '''Nine of the 13 individuals that perished in Saturday's crash, where a private bus plunged into a gorge at Khopoli, were members of Bajiprabhu Dhol Tasha, a traditional music group from Goregaon. Many of the victims lived in Santosh Nagar, Goregaon East. On Saturday, residents of Santosh Nagar were on edge as they flipped TV news channels to look for updates. Nineteen other members of the Dhol Tasha group were hospitalised after suffering injuries in the crash.The band had gone to Pune for a performance for Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar's Jayanti on Friday. They did not stay back overnight and boarded the private bus early on Saturday to return to Mumbai. Parents of eight-year-old Veer Mandavkar-- the youngest member of the Dhol Tasha group-- were eagerly awaiting his return as this was his maiden trip out of Mumbai for a music performance. They were left numb on learning of the crash and rushed to Khopoli. School boys gathered around Mandavkar's house on Saturday to confirm their worst fears that their friend had passed away. ""He was my best friend,"" said a youngster, looking downcast. Mandavkar had appeared for his class II exams recently and was gifted a new bicycle by his parents. ""He was the ""star attraction"" of the Dhol Tasha group and was very passionate,"" said a relative, adding that Mandavkar had joined the group a few months ago and was juggling his studies alongside practising music at a civic ground on Sundays.Not far from Veer's residence lived Satish Dhumal, 23, the Dhol Tasha group's founder, who died in the bus crash along with his sibling, Swapnil Dhumal, 18. Satish worked at an insurance firm and had formed the band around three years ago. Swapnil later joined him and they gradually assembled Dhol Tasha enthusiasts from across the city. The band performed locally, in the beginning, before expanding. In recent times, the group performed in Ratnagiri and Hyderabad and ran a page on Instagram.""The band members who perished were all under 26. They were working hard to achieve their dreams before their lives were snuffed out so cruelly. This is a black day for all Dhol Tasha groups,"" said Prathamesh Mane, the Dhumals' friend. The victims are largely from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Neighbours rallied around the family of Rahul Gothal, 17, a class XII student who also perished in the bus crash. Gothal's mother was initially told by her family that the youngster had suffered a leg injury in the crash. His father proceeded to Khopoli alone to bring back his remains. His mother was inconsolable on finding out the truth later in the day. Gothal's school teacher visited his home to offer support to the family. Gothal's father works as carwasher while his mother is a maid. He is also survived by a young sister.'''[/INST]

    '''A 15-year-old girl riding pillion on a motorcycle behind her 17-year-old sister and a male friend died after a crane brushed past them on Western Express Highway at Goregaon (east) recently. Police have arrested the driver of the crane, Amarsingh Yadav (23) on charges of negligence. Also, since riding triple seat and without a helmet is illegal, the motorcycle rider, Akshay Pujari (20), who is also the victim's friend, has been issued a challan, the police said. Kirti Yadav, the deceased, was a class 10 student while her older sister, Mamta, is in junior college. They reside at Naigaon (near Vasai) with their family. The incident occurred on Sunday. As it was a weekend, and their school/ college was shut, the Yadav sisters decided to participate in a 'Saibaba palkhi' (procession) at Santacruz (east). They were joined by Pujari. About 400 to 500 others participated in the procession. After walking with the others up to Ghatkopar, the Yadav sisters and their friend took a break for lunch. They then headed back to Santacruz (east) in an autorickshaw. According to Mamta's statement to the police, she and her sister decided to go with Pujari on his motorcycle to Borivli railway station, and then board a train for Naigaon. The group left around 5.30pm with Pujari riding the motorcycle, Mamta was seated pillion behind him and Kirti was seated last. None of them wore helmets. ""The three had reached Nesco ground when a crane brushed past their bike. The motorcycle was speeding and Pujari couldn't control it. The crane brushed past them a second time following which the two-wheeler skidded and the three on the bike were thrown off,"" a police officer said. Mamta and Pujari noticed that Kirti wasn't moving. They tried to revive her and dragged her to the corner of the road. The crane driver couldn't be spotted. The youngsters tried to seek help from motorists passing by, but nobody halted. Mamta then dialled the police emergency number '100' and traffic police personnel came to their aid. Kirti was rushed to the Trauma Care Hospital where she was pronounced dead. Mamta and Pujari were given first aid for minor injuries. Vanrai police registered an FIR the next day and took the crane driver into custody.'''[/INST]

    '''Setting aside a tribunal’s order of ""contributory negligence"" by a biker in a fatal nighttime mishap in 2009 after he collided with a tempo that had stalled on a highway, the Bombay high court has held that the tempo driver was solely responsible as he flouted a rule requiring him to keep his vehicle parking lights on. ""The Rule (109 of Central Motor Vehicles Rules) states that, front and rear parking lights shall remain lit when the vehicle is kept stationary on the road but no such parking lights were put on the offending tempo, so liability of contributory accident cannot be fastened on the deceased by holding that, he should have seen the stationed tempo under the headlight of motorcycle,"" said Justice S G Dige at the Aurangabad Bench of the Bombay HC on October 18. “When there is specific rule in respect of taking precautions by stationary vehicle, if such precautions are not taken by the driver or owner of a stationary vehicle then liability cannot be shifted on motorcycle rider,"" said the HC enhancing compensation for the victim. The biker’s ""aggrieved and dissatisfied"" 40-year-old widow and two minor children had gone in appeal against a judgment of Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Latur.

When he reached Kaushik dhabha on Latur-Ambejogai road at Renapur, he dashed into the stationary motor tempo. He succumbed to his injuries undergoing treatment. Police registered an offence against the tempo driver. Salunke’s kin filed for compensation before the Tribunal. The MACT, however, held the biker to be 50 per cent responsible for the accident. The family said it was dark and could be held even partly responsible as there was no tail lamp on, on the tempo stationed in the middle of the road. No other indicators were given by the tempo driver either. The tempo driver’s lawyer argued that the biker was coming at a ""high and excessive speed"" and there was no headlight on the motorcycle and had it been on he could have seen the tempo. Justice Dige in his ruling said, ""I am unable to understand findings given by the Tribunal regarding contributory negligence of the deceased when it has come on record that, no tail lamps or the indicators of offending tempo were put on or no proper precautions were taken by the driver of the offending tempo, to give a signal to the other vehicles to show that, the offending tempo was stationed on the road"". The HC noted that the tempo driver or any witness was not examined to prove his plea of tail lights being on. The HC said the appellant was entitled to 30 per cent of future prospects as the age of the biker was 46 years and he was in government service. The high court gave the family additional compensation of over Rs 25 lakh, including Rs 15,000 for funeral and transportation expenses.'''[/INST]

    '''A magistrate's court acquitted a 47-year-old Girgaon businessman, accused of running over a child and killing him in 2020, after finding that the minor was crawling across the road and the man was unable to see him. The court said the spot panchanama and tyre marks showed that the driver applied the brakes when he noticed the boy from a distance of four feet which, it held, was not sufficient to control any vehicle. ""It is not the case of the prosecution witness that the car was in high speed and was being driven in rash and negligent manner. The only inference that can be drawn in the circumstances of the case is that the defence put forth by the accused is reasonably probable,"" the court said. The court said that this evidence was sufficient to give benefit of the doubt to the accused. ""Therefore, the prosecution has failed to prove the offences charged against the accused beyond reasonable doubt,"" the metropolitan magistrate said. The accused, Sanjay Mehta, has been out on bail. It was the prosecution's case that on February 1, 2020, at about 9.30am at Grant Road (East), he drove his car in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against a homeless person who was crawling on the road and caused his death. The accused was charged with causing death by negligence which attracts a maximum sentence of two years. he accused pleaded not guilty and said he had been falsely implicated. Two witnesses deposed, a man present near the spot and the investigating officer. The first witness could not identify the accused in court. Referring to the deposition and the photographs of the spot produced by the defence lawyer, the court said, ""...there is a 3 feet height divider in between the road. Therefore, there was no chance of any driver seeing if anybody was crossing in a crawling condition from one side of the road to the other side. Considering this, since the boy was crawling, the accused was not in a position to take notice of him.""'''[/INST]

    '''Two closely-related youths were killed and six others injured when their Innova rammed into a peepal tree on the Eastern Express Highway in Vikhroli around 12.15am on Thursday. The fatal accident comes just over a week after builder Irfan Bilkiya rammed his car into other cars at a crash site on the Bandra-Worli Sea Link last Wednesday, leading to the death of five persons. Junaid Salim Qureshi, 26, was driving the others - all from the same family or locality at Kasaiwada in Kurla (East) - to a Bhiwandi dhaba to celebrate the birthday of one of them. The joyride turned tragic as Junaid and Sahil Qureshi, 18, who was sitting next to him were killed. All of them were brought to Fortis hospital in Mulund, where two were declared dead and Ayan Hasim Qureshi, 18, is said to be critical in the ICU with multiple injuries. The others had minor injuries but were suffering from trauma and are in hospital. Just after Wednesday midnight, Junaid lost control of the Innova and hit the peepal tree on the northbound carriageway of the Eastern Express highway at Vikhroli, said police. The car is suspected to have been travelling at a high speed because the impact was so severe the fire brigade had to be called in to cut open the front doors of the vehicle before the two persons in the front seats could be taken out. Both died. The Vikhroli police have registered an offence of culpable homicide, and rash and negligent driving under the motor vehicles Act against the driver, said Prashant Kadam, the deputy commissioner of police (Zone 7). Blood samples of the deceased as well as the other occupants of the car have been sent for testing. According to early reports, there is no presence of alcohol.'''[/INST]

    '''A now 32-year-old man found guilty of running over a resident in his Vile Parle building in 2012 has been let off on a bond of good behaviour after he told the court that he was recently married, had responsibilities and that he was a first-time offender. The victim was sitting on a bench when he was left fatally injured. Salman Bhaldarwas held guilty of causing death by negligence and rash and negligent driving. He drove the car despite not having a licence. “The entire record of case and rozanama shows that accused continuously present in the court of each date of hearing. The accused has been held guilty for the offence which is not punishable for death sentence or imprisonment for life. Previous conviction of the accused has not been proved. Therefore, I wish to give benefit of Probation of Offenders Act to the accused,” metropolitan magistrate CP Kashid said. Under Probation of Offenders Act, an accused can be released on a bond of good behaviour instead of serving a sentence. The accused may have to spend time in jail if he violates the court’s conditions relating to good behaviour and maintaining peace. “Instead of sentencing him, be released on his entering into a bond of Rs 10,000, to appear and to receive sentence when called upon during the period of one year from the date of judgment and in the mean time to keep the peace and be of good behavior,” the magistrate said. The maximum sentence attracted in the case was two years’ imprisonment. The court also directed the accused to pay Rs 5,000 compensation to the son of the victim, Mahesh Patkar. The eyewitness submitted that on November 26, 2012, at about 7.30 pm, when he was between two buildings in the complex, a car came from the front and rammed into Patkar who was siting on concrete bench. He said that it was a one-way and many people used to sit there in the evenings. The witness said he heard Patkar screaming.'''[/INST]

    '''MUMBAI: A 16-month-old toddler and her mother were killed, while her father suffered injuries after a cement mixer rammed into their motorcycle at Goregaon East on Saturday. Police said the south-bound stretch of the Western Express Highway, where the crash occurred, was pockmarked which could have been a contributory factor for the crash. The cement mixer driver was arrested and subsequently released on bail. Vile Parle residents Abdul Khalid Shaikh, 26, his wife, Nilofer, 25, and their daughter, Zainab, had set out for a family event with their relatives on Saturday. Shaikh works as a madarsa teacher. ""My nephew, Shifanuddin Sayyad, had come down from Hyderabad for a visit. We made plans to meet my sister's family at Kandivali for dinner, with my nephew and my mother accompanying us,"" Shaikh said in his statement to the police. After dinner, the group started to head back home to Vile Parle. Shaikh was riding a motorcycle with his wife and child seated pillion. Sayyad and Shaikh's mother were on another two-wheeler. At 11pm, Shaikh was on the flyover opposite Oberoi mall when a heavy vehicle rammed into his motorcycle from the rear. ""I lost control of my vehicle and all three of us landed on the road. My right leg was trapped beneath my motorcycle and it took me some time to free himself. By then, the cement mixer had crushed my wife and child. They were bleeding profusely and had suffered head injuries,"" Shaikh said in the statement. He waved to Sayyad who was coming up and gestured at him to stop the cement mixer. Sayyad ran after the mixer and sought help from other motorists on the stretch. They managed to bring the cement mixer to a halt and called the police. A doctor was summoned to the site and he pronounced Nilofer and Zainab dead. The mixer driver, Sudarshan Saroj, 51, was taken to the Kurar police station where he was booked under section 304 (A) of the IPC. Shaikh had to be rushed to the Babasaheb Ambedkar Hospital in Kandivali as his arms and legs were hurt. ""Saroj has been released on bail. We have sent his blood samples to the forensic lab to establish if he was drinking. The stretch where the crash occurred is uneven and covered with pits. We will probe the sequence of events that led to the crash,'' said senior inspector Satish Gadhve, Kurar police. This is the second crash involving the death of a child in Goregaon East in two months. In December, five-month-old Arfan Pathan was killed after a drunk motorist rammed into a motorcycle on which the infant and his parents were commuting. The motorist was also driving in the wrong direction.'''[/INST]

    '''MUMBAI: Ten persons were injured when a ‘speeding’ BEST bus crashed into a dumper near Dadar TT on Wednesday morning. The incident once again highlights the need to train bus drivers on plying cautiously, said BEST committee members. While four were seriously injured, including 52-year-old bus driver Rajendra Kale and conductor Kashiram Dhuri (57), four others, including two teenagers aged 16 and 17 years, sustained minor injuries. “Two more passengers complained of minor injuries but they left the spot without taking treatment,” said BEST spokesperson Manoj Varade. The injured have been shifted to Sion hospital for treatment. A senior BEST official said “the driver either lost control of the vehicle or was speeding”. The dumper truck had halted at a signal (near Khodadad Circle) while a few vehicles, including another BEST bus, broke the signal and were moving ahead. The Tejaswani bus reportedly came at a speed from behind and crashed into the dumper. The Tejaswini bus was ferrying commuters on route number 22 from Marol to Pydhonie, and the mishap occurred en route at Dadar. “Tejaswini are special buses launched by the state government to exclusively ferry women commuters. However, during peak hours, it allows men to board buses,” said BEST committee member Sunil Ganacharya. Doctors at Sion Hospital said four of those admitted had sustained serious injuries, while four had minor wounds. Dean Dr Mohan Joshi said the driver and the conductor suffered severe injuries. “The driver of the vehicle has suffered an injury to the liver,” he said, adding that the conductor too had a fractured rib. A third person suffered a fracture to the head and neck and the fourth was serious and admitted to hospital. BEST committee chairman Ashish Chemburkar visited Sion hospital where he met a few patients and their relatives, and the cost of treatment is being borne by the undertaking. The Matunga police have registered a case of rash and negligent driving in the case. “Looking at the CCTV footage, prima facie it appears it was the BEST driver’s fault. But we are waiting to record his statement before deciding the course of action,” said a police officer.'''[/INST]

    '''MUMBAI: A 10-year-old boy, who is suspected to have walked more than 10km from Kandivli to Vile Parle, was killed in a hit-and-run on Western Express Highway early on Wednesday. Police said Prathamesh Parmar lived with family friends and had left home the previous day to play, but did not return. His father, who works in Goa, is on his way to Mumbai. Around 12.20am, Parmar was on the south-bound arm of WEH. He was near Patra Gate, when a vehicle hit him and sped off. “A police vehicle attached to Andheri police station was passing by the stretch, escorting an accused person for a medical examination. The vehicle driver, who spotted the injured child, quickly lifted him into the vehicle. Parmar was rushed to V N Desai Hospital, where doctors tried to treat him for more than two hours but he succumbed to injuries,” said a police officer. Parmar had suffered multiple injuries on his head and torso, besides some internal injuries. “There was no identification on him. Cameras on WEH captured him walking around for a while. He appeared tired. But there was no camera at the location where he was hit,” said the officer. Vile Parle police took photographs of the body and sent them to all police stations in the city to identify him. They received a call from Samta Nagar police station, where a child had been reported missing on Wednesday. “The boy’s parents had separated in 2017. For some time, his father had enrolled him at an ashram school. Presently, he was living with family friends in Kandivli. It is not clear why he did not return to his family friends’ home and where he was heading to. His father said the child knew his way around WEH as the two of them used to travel to Mahim Dargah in the past,” said a senior official. Police officials observed that had a passing motorist stopped to ask the child why he was walking alone on the WEH at night or took him to the nearest police station, he could have been alive.'''[/INST]

    '''MUMBAI: A 58-year-old watchman of a building in Kandivli (west) died after being knocked down by a car whose driver stepped on the accelerator instead of hitting the brakes. The driver, Manali Bhatia (29), a schoolteacher, was arrested and later released on bail. The guard, Dyandev More, was opening the gates of Gaurav Garden Cooperative Housing Society building to let the car in when the accident took place around noon last Wednesday. More was flung a few feet away and he landed on a parked vehicle. He sustained injuries to the head, and died a few hours after he was taken to hospital. Bhatia was arrested on the charge of causing death by negligence. The guard, who had worked at the same housing complex for two years earlier, had returned about a couple of months back from his village in Satara where he had stayed all through the lockdown. The entire family had left for their village last year in March just before the lockdown. Senior inspector of Charkop police station, Manohar Shinde, said that the deceased guard was at the entry gate when he went to open it. “All of a sudden, the car came charging towards him as the driver lost control and hit the gate.” He said that the car has been seized for an inspection which will be conducted by the Regional Transport Office to know the possible cause of the mishap.'''[/INST]

    '''MUMBAI: A 7-year-old schoolboy who was cycling near his home at Malwani in Malad (west) died after coming under the rear wheel of a van around 11.30am on Monday. The boy, Akshay Pawar, lived with his parents, who are daily wage workers, and five sisters in Ambhujwadi slum. The police said that the boy could have lost his balance and come under the van. A probe is on. Locals took the boy to hospital where he was declared dead. His body was sent for an autopsy. The van driver, Mohammad Hadis Ansari, has been taken into custody. As relatives and neighbours gathered to mourn the child’s death, police personnel were deployed to pre-empt trouble from breaking out. This is the second case of a cyclist’s death in the western suburbs this month. On January 5, Masoom Qazi (28), was cycling from Jogeshwari to Juhu gully when he was knocked down by a scooter. He died on January 9. TNN'''[/INST]

    '''MUMBAI: A joyride after bunking college turned tragic for five teenagers when their speeding car rammed into a two-wheeler, killing the rider on the spot at Boisar in Palghar district on Monday. Tarapur police said the teens are out of danger. The friends, all aged 18, sustained injuries when their car turned turtle. Tarapur police have booked driver Hritik Sharma (18) for the death of Laxman Wavre (30) who worked as a garden contractor with Bhabha Atomic Research Centre Colony in Tarapur. Sharma does not have a driving licence. The incident took place around 7.20am when Sharma and his four friends, including two girls, all Class XI students of a junior college in Boisar, decided to bunk lectures and go for a drive to Chinchani, a beach destination at Boisar. They were in their college uniform when the accident took place. P Sharma, who is believed to have borrowed the car from a friend—who was not travelling with them—was speeding down the road. When he reached Kurgaon village, he rammed into the bike. Wavre, the biker who was wearing a helmet, was thrown at a distance and died on the spot. A resident of Popharan village in Boisar, Wavre was on his way to work. He was identified based on his identity card found in his pocket. His family was informed by locals. Sharma tried to control his vehicle but it turned turtle and rammed into a tree. Eyewitnesses said the teens were pulled out of the car by locals. Sharma and his two male friends sustained head and body injuries. The two girls, on rear seats, suffered minor injuries. All five are being treated at Boisar’s Anand Hospital. API Santosh Jadhav said Sharma is booked under IPC and Motor Vehicles Act. He will be arrested after his release from hospital. The car owner was summoned.'''[/INST]

    '''NAVI MUMBAI: A birthday party ended in tragedy as four persons were killed and two injured after a state transport bus rammed into a kaali peeli cab they were travelling in on the Mumbai-Goa highway on Sunday. All the victims are from Mumbai. The mishap between the Asiad ST bus and Eeco car occurred between Amtem and Koleti villages in Pen taluka of Raigad district. The cab with six persons on board was travelling toward Mumbai, while the bus was plying from Nashik to Mahad (Raigad). The speeding bus driver lost control while plying wrongly on the Mumbai-bound carriageway and collided with the car. Vadkhal police assistant inspector Ajit Shinde said, ""The bus driver was speeding toward Mahad (in the direction of Goa), while the Eeco car was plying toward Vadkhal (Mumbai direction). The driver who was wrongly plying on the Mumbai-bound carriageway around 5 pm rammed into the Eeco."" Shinde said the deceased were Mankhurd resident Santosh Sakharkar (38) and Mahalaxmi residents Mangesh Goregaonkar (35), Anil Chandorkar (42) and Santosh Bhonkar (40). The injured are Nalasopara resident, Saiprakash Nadkar (38) and Lower Parel resident Jaysingh Kargutkar (28). The six had gone to celebrate Chandorkar's birthday at Karnali village in Raigad on Friday. Locals blamed the national highway authorities for the delay in the highway work saying uneven carriageway crossing was being allowed, leading to confusion among drivers and mishaps. Police have booked the bus driver, Kiran Nikan, who has been admitted to hospital with injuries. Following the mishap, traffic was hit on the Mumbai- bound carriageway and was diverted to the Goa-bound carriageway'''[/INST]

    '''MUMBAI: A 21-year-old pillion rider died while the biker is in a critical state at KEM hospital after an autorickshaw coming in the wrong direction collided with the bike on Sunday morning. The pillion rider, Rohit Ghosalkar, was thrown in the air and fell 25 feet down from the Vakola flyover, killing him on the spot. The biker, Omkar Devrukhkar (25), survived as he fell by the side of bridge. Vakola police are searching for the auto driver who fled from the spot after abandoning his vehicle immediately after the incident. Police said the auto driver had gone into hiding and did not own the vehicle. “Devrukhkar, a freelance photographer, had left his Wadala home along with Ghosalkar for a marriage photo shoot at Malad on Saturday, and was returning home early on Sunday when the accident occurred,’ his friend Gaurav Desai told TOI. Ghosalkar was a delivery boy. Gaurav and other friends took Devrukhkar and Ghosalkar to the hospital. Ghosalkar was declared dead on admission, while Devrukhkar is in ICU. Desai said few friends had gone for a ride in the western suburbs and were returning home. Ghosalkar and Devrukhkar joined the group midway. Ghosalkar’s younger brother Ritwik was on another friend’s bike and had gone ahead when the incident occurred. “The auto nearly collided with our bike first. After a short distance, we turned back and were unable to find Ghosalkar’s bike. When we went back, we saw Devrukhkar lying on the flyover, badly injured. There was a severe injury on his right eye.

    '''MUMBAI: When passersby at Dahisar’s Anand Nagar saw a car knock down an elderly scooterist on Saturday night, some ran towards the four-wheeler to check on the motorist and stop him from fleeing. They didn’t know they would find an elderly man passed out at the wheel due to an heart attack. The biker, Chandrakant Waghela (72) is in the ICU of a private hospital, awaiting a surgery. “My father is in a serious condition and we are very worried given his age,” Waghela’s son, Jigar, told TOI. He has suffered multiple fractures on his right leg, several stitches on his face and injuries,” said Waghela’s wife, Prabha. A carpenter based out of Dahisar, Waghela was returning home from work. “People gathered after the accident. Three of them brought my father to a hospital nearby and stayed with him till midnight. These men told us what had happened. The car hurtled down a flyover in full speed and hit my father’s scooter on the right side,” said Jigar. Waghela kept mumbling ‘Jigar’ when people came to his aid and soon, passed out. Someone accessed his mobile and dialled Jigar. Prabha said, “We are a middle-class family and hospitalisation expenses are too much.” Waghela lives with his wife, son, daughter-in-law and grandchild. The motorist, Suraj Kumar, hailed from Punjab and lived in Borivli. The family left for north India for his last rites and were not reachable for a comment'''[/INST]

    '''NAVI MUMBAI: In a suspected case of drunk driving, two persons, including a seven-year-old boy, were killed and five injured after the driver of a Skoda car lost control on Sunday evening. The incident took place near a bar in Sector 6, Kamothe. The driver fled the spot. According to eyewitnesses, the Skoda driver was heading toward the Kamothe nodal main road when the car spun out of control and rammed into seven bikes and a school bus in the market area. Kamothe police said the deceased include Sarthak Chopade (7) and Vaibhav Gurav (32). The injured are Sarthak’s mother Sadhana Chopade, Sifa Sarang (16), Atish Patil, Prashant Mane and Shradha Jadhav. Two other minor girls were injured in the accident, but they could not be identified as they left the accident spot. Locals gathered at the spot and rushed the victims to MGM Hospital, Kamothe. Police sources said a liquor box was found in the car. Kamothe police inspector Madhukar Bhate said, “The driver fled the spot. A manhunt has been launched to catch him.” A local resident, Milind Kambli, said, “Two of the injured girls left the spot in an autorickshaw, while one girl was admitted to hospital.” Sarthak’s relative Madhukar Chopade said, “Sarthak and his mother had gone to the market to buy vegetables and were standing on the road side when the speeding car hit them. Sarthak died on the spot, while his mother has sustained fractures on the leg.” Javed Shaik, a relative of Sifa Sarang, said she was also standing on the road when the Skoda hit her. “She sustained injuries on her head, but is out of danger now.” An eyewitness, requesting anonymity, claimed a female occupant of the Skoda car was screaming. The eyewitness also claimed to have recognized the driver as a local. “Kamothe resident, Harbindersing Matharoo was at the wheel. He is a senior citizen who is reported to be mentally disturbed and also has a drinking problem,” the eyewitness said. However, police have not confirmed this.'''[/INST]

The deceased SUV driver has been identified as Rahul Patil (37) who ran construction and hotel businesses and was founder-president of R K Patil Charitable Trust. He was the nephew of Panvel APMC chairman Rajendra Patil as well as former councillor of Panvel municipal council Sandeep Patil. The deceasedbiker has been identified as Kalamboli resident Reuben Pillai (25) who worked as a bartender in Vashi. Pillai was returning home after work. Suresh Pandit (29), a childhood friend of Pillai, said he was to marry his girlfriend later this year and that he is survived by his parents and a younger brother. “He was the sole breadwinner as his father worked as a security guard.” Patil is survived by his wife and two children. He was reportedly returning home after dropping his friends in Vashi after a birthday party in his village, Wahal in Panvel taluka, when the accident took place. Police sub-inspector Anil Shinkar of NRI coastal police station said, “The biker was riding in the third lane when the speeding SUV rammed into it near Sector 50, Seawoods. Motorists who were behind the SUV alleged that the vehicle was speeding at around 200kmph when it rammed into the bike; the biker was thrown in the air and killed on impact. The SUV veered off the road, somersaulted a couple of times and rammed into the peripheral poles and the crash guard. Although the air bags opened, they were of no use as the SUV driver was thrown out of his vehicle; he was not wearing his seat belt and the vehicle also skidded for about 50 metres.” Shinkar addeed that occupants of other vehicles halted to help the victims. One carried the injured duo in his car to MGM Hospital in CBD-Belapur but they were declared as brought dead on arrival. An FIR was registered against the deceased SUV driver for causing death by rash and negligent driving under Indian Penal Code and Motor Vehicles Act.

    '''MUMBAI: An Audi driven at speed on the wrong side by a drunk woman hit a taxi headlong on the Eastern Freeway in the early hours of Tuesday. So severe was the impact that the fire brigade had to be called to cut through mangled steel to pull out the taxi’s driver. He and his front seat passenger didn’t survive. His three back seat passengers are in hospital with fractures and other injuries. The woman, Janhavi Ajit Gadkar (35), works in the legal cell of a top corporation at Nariman Point. The deceased are taxi driver Hussain Sayyed (57) and soap trader Haji Salim Sabuwala (50). The injured are Sabuwala’s wife Hafeeza (45), daughter Sabiya (22) and son Noman (18). An RTO officer who examined the accident site and the vehicles involved said that looking at the impact, it seemed that both vehicles were at high speed, with the Audi clocking at least 120kmph. He said Janhavi escaped injuries or death because of her car’s airbags. Around 7pm on Monday, Janhavi left her office with two colleagues for Hotel Marine Plaza, where she drank whisky. They parted three hours later, but Janhavi spent time in her Audi Q3 on Marine Drive till around 12.30am. Then she started driving towards her Chembur flat, which is in an upmarket building near RK Studios. She took P D’Mello Road and then the Freeway, driving on the wrong side. Half a kilometre before Panjarpol tunnel, near Shivaji Nagar Masjid, she grazed two cars before colliding with the taxi. The accident occurred between 1.10 and 1.20am. The Sabuwalas, who live in Null Bazar, Nagpada, were returning from an eatery in Bhiwandi, where they had gone to celebrate son Nauman's success in the SSC exams. An eyewitness of the accident, who gave his name as Hassan, said, “I was returning with my family when the incident occurred. I immediately got hold of the woman and called the RCF police. Passers-by removed the injured taxi passengers and took them to Sion hospital. We also called the fire brigade to free the driver. Janhavi tried to hush up the matter by offering payment to the victims on the spot and telling us not to call the police.” Dilip Raut of the RCF police said Janhavi was so drunk that she could barely stand. “We immediately sent her for medical tests. The reports are awaited.” Janhavi has been arrested under several sections of the IPC and the Motor Vehicle Act, including culpable homicide not amounting to murder and rash driving. If convicted, she may get a maximum of ten years of rigorous imprisonment. She has been remanded in police custody till Wednesday. Assistant commissioner of police Jeevaji Jadhav said, “The road was almost empty. Janhavi, driving under the influence of alcohol, did not realize her direction was wrong. She entered the Freeway on the wrong side at its mouth at Masjid Bunder.” Joint commissioner (law and order) Deven Bharti said the police have strong evidence and witnesses to prove the case against Janhavi.'''[/INST]

    '''n a shocking turn of events, new evidence has emerged that challenges the initial account of a fatal accident between Rolls Royce and Oil tanker on the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway new Gurgaon. On August 22, a diesel tanker, driven by Rampreet and his co-driver, met with a devastating crash that claimed both their lives. In initial reports, it was reported that oil tanker driver Rampreet was allegedly driving on the wrong side of the road, causing a head-on collision with a Rolls-Royce at high speed. However, as per a TOI report, a CCTV footage has completely altered the narrative surrounding the incident. Contrary to the initial assumptions, the footage clearly shows that Rampreet was driving on the right side and following all road rules. The unexpected revelation points the finger at the Rolls-Royce, which was reportedly racing at an astonishing speed of over 200kmph. The luxury vehicle reportedly hit the tanker from back, leading to the tragic accident. The occupants of the Rolls-Royce, according to the police, sustained injuries and were transported to Gurgaon for medical treatment. A deeper investigation into the accident has uncovering crucial details. The Rolls-Royce was part of a big convoy of 20 vehicles, which was escorted by two vehicles equipped with red beacons and security personnel dressed in blue safari suits. CCTV footage from Alipur captured the convoy's movement towards Rajasthan at 11.11am. Within minutes, the Rolls-Royce veered away from the convoy, changed lanes, and accelerated significantly. Over the next 12 minutes, it covered a distance of 40km and even passed through a toll plaza. This data suggests that the vehicle was traveling at approximately 200kmph when it violently collided with the tanker near Nuh, at the 40.9km mark of the expressway. The impact caused the Rolls-Royce to lose control and collide with the middle lane of the tanker. Tragically, the car caught fire, and the tanker flipped, exacerbating the devastation. After the accident, security personnel from the convoy rescued the Rolls-Royce's occupants, and the convoy subsequently reversed course and proceeded back toward Gurgaon, as shown in video footage from the toll plaza. Reports from Medanta Hospital confirmed that two passengers from the Rolls-Royce, a 49-year-old man, and a 31-year-old woman, were admitted with fractures and minor injuries. They are currently in stable condition and are undergoing treatment. The police were alerted to the accident by a commuter, while the NHAI control room also received an alert. Law enforcement and NHAI teams reached the scene swiftly, rescuing the three passengers who remained inside the truck. Notably, the tanker's diesel did not spill after the collision, preventing a potentially catastrophic scenario. Had there been a fuel leak, the consequences could have been even more dire. It's worth mentioning that the initial FIR filed on the day of the accident did not name any individuals, keeping the investigation open to further developments.'''[/INST]

    '''The driver of the truck, which hit several vehicles on Mumbai-Bengaluru highway in Maharashtra's Pune district and caused a pile-up, had apparently switched off its engine on a bridge slope resulting in the accident, a police official said on Monday. Switching off the engine affects the vehicle's braking ability and this possibly resulted in the truck hitting other vehicles on the bridge slope on Sunday, as per a probe being conducted into the accident by the Regional Transport Office (RTO), he said. At least 24 vehicles were damaged late Sunday evening after the truck lost control on the downward slope of Navale bridge on the Mumbai-Bengaluru highway in Pune. More than 20 people suffered injuries in the accident and eight of them were hospitalised, an official said. A case was registered against the absconding truck driver, identified as Maniram Yadav, under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Motor Vehicles Act. The driver fled from the spot after the accident and efforts were on to trace him, police said. Assistant Commissioner of Police Sunil Pawar said, ""The probe by the RTO indicates that the truck driver might have switched off the engine by turning off the ignition while on the slope. If the engine is switched off, it affects the vehicle's braking ability. That is how the truck might have gone hitting the vehicles on the slope."" The truck was from Tamil Nadu and was heavily loaded with some goods, he said. A man, whose car was damaged in the accident, had said the speeding truck first rammed into some of the vehicles on the road, which in-turn hit some other vehicles leading to the pile-up. ""Our car was also hit. We were four people in the vehicle and fortunately, nothing happened to us as the airbags opened, but we saw that several vehicles around us on the road were badly hit,"" he said. Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Supriya Sule, who is the Lok Sabha member from Baramati in Pune district, visited the accident spot on Monday. Sule in a tweet said she spoke to officials of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), police, and the National Highway Authority of India. ""They all will visit the spot to assess it and taking that report, we will meet Union Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari and discuss what measures can be taken to make this road accident free,"" she tweeted. It is necessary to make the Road Safety Act more effective, she said. ""Citizens also need to follow all the traffic rules. If there are service roads, good footpaths, and traffic rules are followed, it will definitely help reduce the accidents,"" Sule tweeted. She said it is necessary for the PMC to make a service road at this place (the accident spot), but it has not been done. ""At the same time, it is also necessary to take measures to reduce the slope at the spot with the help of experts,"" she said.'''[/INST]

    '''A Mumbai local court has sent the driver of the sports utility vehicle (SUV), who rammed into couple of stationary vehicles including an ambulance at the Bandra-Worli Sea Link in Mumbai killing five persons, to one-day police custody. He told the cops that he was trying to connect the mobile phone charger when the accident happened. The police informed the court that the SUV driver, Irfan Abdul Rahim Bilakiya, had in his statement claimed that his mobile handset was discharged and the accident was caused after he lost control over his Hyundai Creta while attempting to put the phone on charge. He, however, also claimed that it was negligent on the part of authorities to not put barricades or signage or traffic safety cones to indicate the presence of stationary vehicles on the bridge. The 40-year-old Bilakiya was arrested from his residence at Mohammed Ali Road in South Mumbai on Wednesday, hours after the accident. He has been booked under IPC sections 304A (death of any person by doing any rash or negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide), 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others), among others after an FIR (first information report) was registered against him at the Worli Police Police Station. As per police report, Bilakiya, a businessman, was returning home from suburban Jogeshwari when he allegedly rammed his SUV into three stationary cars and an ambulance on the bridge at around 3 am on Wednesday. Five persons were killed and eight others injured in the accident. After the accident, the SUV driver went to Saifee Hospital, where he received treatment for hand injury and afterwards proceeded to his residence from where he was arrested later in the day, said the police official. The police took the help of CCV footage of the Sea Link and obtained details of his vehicle before nabbing Bilakiya, he said. The police were ascertaining if the SUV driver was under the influence of alcohol and have sent his blood samples for forensic examination, the official said. They were also examining whether the SUV was speeding on the 5.6km-long cable-stayed bridge, which connects Bandra in the western suburbs to Worli in south Mumbai, he said.'''[/INST]

    '''Thirteen persons, including at least five minors, were killed and 29 others injured after a bus carrying young male and female members of a traditional music troupe fell into a gorge on the old Mumbai-Pune highway in Raigad district of Maharashtra early on Saturday, police said. The private bus with 42 persons on board was going from Pune to Mumbai when it plunged into the 300-feet deep gorge in the Bor Ghat mountain pass section, better known as Khandala Ghat, around 4.50 am. The accident occurred near Khopoli town in the district, around 70 km from Mumbai, a senior police official said. According to police, the deceased included a six-year-old boy and a girl aged 15, while of the total number of injured, at least six are minors. Most of the music troupe members were in their twenties or teenagers, who were heading back to Mumbai after taking part in an event in Pimpri Chinchwad near Pune city. Expressing grief over the incident, Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde announced an ex-gratia of Rs five lakh to the kin of each deceased. He said the condition of five of the injured is critical. Union Home Minister Amit Shah expressed sorrow and spoke to CM Shinde and his deputy Devendra Fadnavis about the accident. ""The bus was carrying 42 members of 'Baji Prabhu Zanj Pathak' based in Mumbai's Goregaon. They were returning to Goregaon after taking part in an event in Pimpri Chinchwad area in Pune district. The bus, which had left the venue around 1 am on Saturday, fell into the gorge on the highway near Shingroba temple after its driver lost control,"" the police official said, adding that 13 of them died in the incident, which left 29 others injured. On learning about the incident, a team of the local police, volunteers of Yashwanti Hikers' group from Khopoli and some personnel of IRB company rushed to the spot and launched a rescue operation, the police said. The injured were admitted to three different hospitals - the Mahatma Gandhi Mission (MGM) Hospital at Kamothe in Navi Mumbai, a government hospital in Khopoli and a private facility there, they said. The deceased and the injured were from Goregaon and Sion in Mumbai and Virar in neighbouring Palghar district, Raigad Superintendent of Police (SP) Somnath Gharge said. In a tweet in Hindi, Union minister Shah said, ""The road accident in Raigad, Maharashtra is very sad. Talked to Chief Minister @mieknathshinde and Deputy Chief Minister @Dev_Fadnavis in this regard. The local administration is engaged in relief work. I express my condolences to the families of the deceased and wish the injured a speedy recovery."" CM Shinde visited the MGM Hospital in Navi Mumbai to enquire about the health of the injured. After that, he also visited the accident site. ""Of the total injured persons, the condition of five is critical. I have instructed the doctors to provide the best possible treatment to save their lives,"" he said. Deepak Sawant, who lost his 18-year-old daughter Jui, in the accident, said he had spoken to her when she reached Pune safely for the event. ""While leaving for Pune, Jui told me she will telephone me when she reaches the city, which she did. That was my last conversation with my daughter,"" said a distraught Sawant, who is employed as a security guard. Jui had just appeared for her Class 11 examination, he said. Among the dead were brothers Satish and Swapnil Dhumal, who had left Mumbai on Friday to attend the event and boarded the bus in Pune in the early hours of the day. ""We were college students and associated with the troupe. I was asleep when we were informed about the accident. We immediately rushed to Khopoli and identified Swapnil's body,"" said Ganesh Bhole, a friend and neighbour of the brothers. One of the rescuers at the scene, Khopoli-resident Dr Riyaz Pathan, said he received a phone call from a fellow medical practitioner about the accident. ""After reaching the spot, we managed to bring out 10 to 15 passengers, one of them dead,"" he said. He claimed there were no safety railings at the spot, adding that their presence may have averted the accident.'''[/INST]

    '''Four friends travelling in a car drowned, while another occupant was missing after their vehicle coming from Rajasthan plunged into a lake near a village in Gujarat's Gandhinagar district, said police on Tuesday. All five were friends and returning from the adjoining state on Monday night after holidaying. While the bodies of the four men were fished out from the lake situated near Dashela village of Gandhinagar district on Tuesday evening, a search was on for the missing car occupant, said Kaizad Dastur, chief fire officer of the state capital. The village is situated near the Chiloda-Himmatnagar highway, and the five men, all in their late 20s, were coming towards the Naroda area of Ahmedabad, said Chiloda police inspector, AS Asari. Of these five, four hailed from Naroda, while one Gaurang Bhatt was a resident of Dashela village. They went to Rajasthan in a car a few days ago on a holiday trip. While returning on Monday night, they first went to Dashela to drop Bhatt. However, they all went incommunicado around 9 pm, and their relatives were also clueless about their whereabouts. Meanwhile, one of the relatives of a missing man learned that a mobile tower at Dashela had registered the latter's last cellphone location on Monday night before their phones went silent, said the inspector. Based on the information shared by the relative, a team of the Chiloda police reached Dashela on Tuesday afternoon and found three bodies floating in the lake, which was very close to an internal road, said AS Asari. It is possible the car driver, who was from Naroda, could not make a judgment during the night and drove his vehicle into the lake as the adjacent road was waterlogged due to rain. A person named Shailesh is still missing, and a search was on for him, said the police inspector. The car might have slipped into the lake when the driver was attempting to cross the waterlogged road during the night, said chief fire officer Dastur.'''[/INST]

    '''Post-Mortem Confirms Farmer Died Of Tractor Accident Injuries: UP Police The man, identified as Navrit Singh from Rampur, around 180 km from the national capital, had recently returned to his native village from Australia, where his wife is a student. India NewsReported by Alok Pandey, Edited by Vaibhav Tiwari (with inputs from Agencies)Updated: January 27, 2021 6:29 pm IST Post-Mortem Confirms Farmer Died Of Tractor Accident Injuries: UP Police Tractor Rally: Over 300 personnel were injured in Tuesday's violence (File) Lucknow: A farmer from Uttar Pradesh who died in Delhi's ITO area while participating in Tuesday's tractor rally that descended into violence and chaos, was not shot as claimed by some of his fellow protesters yesterday, the UP police said today. The 26-year-old man's post-mortem examination has confirmed that he died from injuries received in a tractor accident, police added. ""The post-mortem report clarifies that he was not shot. He died of the antemortem injuries which he received after his tractor overturned as seen in a viral video,"" Avinash Chandra, a senior UP police officer, was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. CCTV footage of the incident released yesterday showed the man driving a blue tractor towards police barricades as apparently the rattled security personnel brace for impact. The speeding tractor, in an attempt to break through the cordon, rams the barricades and overturns. While the Delhi police had said yesterday that he died because of the accident injuries, some protesters had claimed he was shot dead. The man, identified as Navrit Singh from Rampur, around 180 km from the national capital, had recently returned to his native village from Australia, where his wife is a student. He had joined the farmers' protest against the three central agriculture laws on Tuesday. ""We came together to participate in the parade but never knew it would happen,"" a neighbour told news agency PTI. The tractor rally was called by an umbrella body of 40 farmers' unions to press for their demand for repeal of the three laws. The rally, as agreed by the unions, was to begin at around 11.30 AM and pass through the outskirts of Delhi. Thousands of farmers on tractors and other vehicles, however, had begun pushing into the national capital through unplanned routes by 8 AM, knocking down barricades and clashing with the police. The farmers, who had been trying to get to the iconic Red Fort in central Delhi, were stopped by the police at ITO. By noon, hundreds of the protesters had reached the Red Fort. A protester also hoisted a religious flag at a flagpole on the ramparts of the monument, triggering outrage. Over 300 personnel were injured in Tuesday's violence and 22 cases have been registered, police said today. Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com The farmers' unions have distanced themselves from the violence and alleged a conspiracy to ""torpedo"" their peaceful movement.'''[/INST]

    '''On Camera, Accident That Left A Farmer Dead During Protests The farmer has been identified as Navdeep Singh Hundal, a 26-year-old from Uttarakhand's Bajpur area, who recently got married, according to his fellow farmers India NewsReported by Sunil Prabhu, Edited by Chandrashekar Srinivasan (with inputs from PTI)Updated: January 26, 2021 7:34 pm IST Farmers and police clashed in unprecedented scenes in Delhi on Republic Day New Delhi: One farmer died after a speeding tractor overturned near the ITO junction in central Delhi, the police said Tuesday, amid clashes with farmers taking out a rally to protest the centre's new agriculture laws. CCTV footage of the incident showed a blue tractor crashing through yellow Delhi Police barricades at high speed before rolling over twice and coming to rest by the side of the road. However, some farmers at the site - near the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Marg - claimed he was killed in police firing and began a sit-in protest. The farmer has been identified as Navdeep Singh Hundal, 26, from Uttarakhand's Bajpur area. Two other farmers, Angrez Singh and his son from a village in Uttarakhand's Rudrapur, told NDTV Navdeep Singh had recently been married. ""This boy.. his name is Navneet Singh. He was driving the tractor... he was injured by a police bullet and died on the spot,"" Angrez Singh said. Late in the afternoon farmers finally allowed Navdeep Singh's body to be removed. The tractor was part of a group from the Ghazipur border that had taken a detour from the agreed upon route for Tuesday's rally, a senior police officer told news agency PTI. The ITO area saw fierce clashes between farmers and police. A police bus was also hijacked and the cops resorted to lathi charges and firing tear gas shells to control the situation. In the evening a tense stand-off ensued between a group of protesters and a large contingent of security forces, including police, CRPF (Central Reserve Police Force) and RAF (Rapid Action Force). Earlier in the day two farmers were injured after another tractor - which was also speeding - overturned near the Chilla border that separates Delhi and Noida.

The farmers had been given permission to take out their tractor rally after the annual parade at Rajpath, the iconic boulevard at the heart of the city, and along pre-designated routes. But crowds swelled at the borders at around 8 am - even before the parade started, and hundreds of farmers forced open the police barricades and marched into the city. As the day progressed groups of farmers broke from agreed routes and clashed violently with cops. Some cops were injured trying to stop the protesters, who were tear-gassed and baton-charged. By the afternoon, a group of farmers drove their tractors into the Red Fort complex, where protesters gained access to the outer courtyards and ramparts of the iconic Mughal-era fort. Visuals showed farmers hoisting a sacred flag of Sikhs at an empty second flagpole. The farmers have blamed ""anti-social elements"" for the violence and the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a federation of 40 farmer unions, has dissociated itself from the chaos and appealed for calm.'''[/INST]

Delhi NewsPress Trust of IndiaUpdated: January 17, 2021 4:01 pm IST Delhi High Court Says Parents Of Road Accident Victim Entitled To Compensation The Delhi high court said parents are considered in law as dependent on their children. (File) New Delhi: Parents are dependent on their children at some stage of life and it would be inequitable to deny compensation to those who lost their ward in a road accident, the Delhi High Court has said. Justice JR Midha said even if parents are not dependent on their children at the time of an accident, they will certainly be dependent, both financially and emotionally, upon them at the later stage of their life, as the children were dependent upon their parents in their initial years. The high court's observations came while awarding compensation for loss of dependency to a woman, who lost her 23-year-old son in a road accident in 2008, and enhanced the award amount from ₹ 2.42 lakh to ₹ 6.80 lakh. The motor accident claims tribunal had held that though the accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle, the parents of the victim were not entitled to compensation for loss of dependency but only to compensation for loss of the estate. It had held that the victim's father was working with the Delhi Police as a Sub-Inspector and was, therefore, not dependent upon his son. It had also said that his mother cannot be said to be dependent upon the victim as her husband was employed with the Delhi Police. The high court, however, said it was of the view that parents are considered in law as dependent on their children, considering that they are bound to support their parents in their old age, when the parents would be unable to maintain themselves. The court, which said the law imposes a responsibility on the children to maintain their parents, added that ""it would therefore be unfair as well as inequitable to deny compensation for loss of dependency to a parent, who may not be dependent on his/her child at the time of accident per se but would become dependent at him or her later age"". It further said that provisions of Code of Criminal Procedure, Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act and Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act cast an obligation on the children to maintain their parents and these legislations recognise the legal rights of parents to be maintained by their children. Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com The high court directed that a copy of this judgement be sent to the Registrar General who shall circulate it to all Motor Accident Claims Tribunals to note that the principles relating to the loss to the estate in Keith Rowe judgement and Dinesh Adhlak judgement are not applicable to the claim of the parents in respect of the death of their child, claim of children in respect of death of their parents and claim of a spouse in respect of death of his/her spouse in a motor accident. Post a comment It said the copy of this judgement be also sent to Delhi Judicial Academy to sensitise the claims tribunals about the principles laid down by this court in this verdict.'''[/INST]

Ahmedabad: Two teenage girls miraculously escaped death when a speeding car hit their two-wheeler in Ahmedabad. The horrific accident was caught on CCTV cameras, but it took the police more than 12 hours to register a case and launch a hunt for the driver of the car. Engineering students Vekariya and Freni Pala were going towards a multiplex in western Ahmedabad on Tuesday afternoon when they were hit by a speeding Hyundai i-20. ""It's a miracle. When we saw the footage we were shocked. The car was moving at a high speed in the service lane,'' said Kalpesh Vekariya, father of one of the girls. The two girls are reported to be stable now. The car was owned by a businessman Alok Thakkar. But his relative Jayesh turned up at the Satellite police station, claiming the vehicle was being driven by an employee, Alkesh.

    '''Four friends travelling in a car drowned, while another occupant was missing after their vehicle coming from Rajasthan plunged into a lake near a village in Gujarat's Gandhinagar district, said police on Tuesday. All five were friends and returning from the adjoining state on Monday night after holidaying. While the bodies of the four men were fished out from the lake situated near Dashela village of Gandhinagar district on Tuesday evening, a search was on for the missing car occupant, said Kaizad Dastur, chief fire officer of the state capital. The village is situated near the Chiloda-Himmatnagar highway, and the five men, all in their late 20s, were coming towards the Naroda area of Ahmedabad, said Chiloda police inspector, AS Asari. Of these five, four hailed from Naroda, while one Gaurang Bhatt was a resident of Dashela village. They went to Rajasthan in a car a few days ago on a holiday trip. While returning on Monday night, they first went to Dashela to drop Bhatt. However, they all went incommunicado around 9 pm, and their relatives were also clueless about their whereabouts. Meanwhile, one of the relatives of a missing man learned that a mobile tower at Dashela had registered the latter's last cellphone location on Monday night before their phones went silent, said the inspector. Based on the information shared by the relative, a team of the Chiloda police reached Dashela on Tuesday afternoon and found three bodies floating in the lake, which was very close to an internal road, said AS Asari. It is possible the car driver, who was from Naroda, could not make a judgment during the night and drove his vehicle into the lake as the adjacent road was waterlogged due to rain. A person named Shailesh is still missing, and a search was on for him, said the police inspector. The car might have slipped into the lake when the driver was attempting to cross the waterlogged road during the night, said chief fire officer Dastur.'''[/INST]

The incident happened in the evening when the underage driver apparently lost control of the Honda City and hit another vehicle. Senior police inspector, Gujarat University SJ Vaghasiya said the speeding car hit around six to seven vehicles, and the police have registered a case of rash driving. One of the students held in the incident also has another case of rash driving registered against him. The speeding Honda City first hit a Cruise car and began losing control.

The police arrested one Vimal (name changed) while his companion Chirag (name changed) managed to escape from the spot. Cops said Vimal was the one in the driving seat. Vimal later allegedly told the police that initially Chirag was driving the car when the first accident happened. So Vimal took control of the car but ended up escalating matters.

    '''Delhi Boy Dies In Accident, 3 Friends Dump His Body, Avoid Hospital: Cops The Delhi Police said on Monday that the three accused instead of taking the injured Nitesh to a hospital dumped him at an underpass, due to which he died. India NewsAsian News InternationalUpdated: March 14, 2023 3:25 pm IST Delhi Boy Dies In Accident, 3 Friends Dump His Body, Avoid Hospital: Cops The auto met with an accident in the Nand Nagri area and overturned. (Representational) New Delhi: Three accused including a minor were arrested for allegedly dumping their friend, who was critically injured after they met with an accident, at an underpass in the Vivek Vihar area, police said. The boy has been identified as Nitesh. The Delhi Police said on Monday that the three accused instead of taking the injured Nitesh to a hospital dumped him at an underpass, due to which he died. As per the police, the four friends had gone for an auto ride after the Holi Dahan party on the intervening night of March 7-8. The auto belonged to one of the friends named Pawan, who was driving the vehicle. The auto met with an accident in the Nand Nagri area and overturned. The accident left Nitesh injured. Instead of taking him to a hospital, the three of them took him from the spot in the same auto and dumped him in an underpass in the Vivek Vihar area. Because of not getting treatment on time, the injured succumbed to his injuries, the police said. On March 8, the police received information about a body being found in the Vivek Vihar area and started an investigation. While scanning through the CCTV footage, the police saw the footage of the three accused dumping the boy near the underpass. Based on the inputs and further investigation, the police ultimately nabbed the three accused. While the two accused namely Pawan and Brij Mohan have been arrested, another minor accused has been detained, the police said. The police have registered cases under sections 304, 201 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Talking to ANI, the victim's father Rajendra Gupta expressed doubt on the case being that of merely an accident and alleged that his son was murdered. ""Nitesh had gone to the Holika Dahan party on the evening of March 7 and then did not return, we tried to find him a lot. His friends had taken him for the ride. It was only three days later on March 10, that we came to know that Nitesh had died. The police told us that his body was found at the underpass. We have performed the last rites of Nitesh after the post-mortem on March 11,"" he said. The boy's sister Baby Gupta also alleged the involvement of Nitesh's friends in his death and demanded justice. ""One of the arrested accused met us on March 8, but even then he didn't tell us about the accident. On being asked, he said that he doesn't know where Nitesh is. My marriage is slated to happen next month, and Nitesh had done a lot of preparations regarding that. He was the only brother among the six sisters. My father is sick and works as a fruit vendor. Nitesh was our support but he is no longer with us. I suspect that something wrong happened with Nitesh. We want justice, and the culprits should be severely punished,"" she said.'''[/INST]

    '''Delhi Bus Crashes Into Cemetary, Damages Wall The incident occurred on Saturday morning at 6:50 am, police said. Delhi NewsAsian News InternationalUpdated: March 04, 2023 10:21 pm IST The accident damaged 10-12 graves. New Delhi: A cluster bus crashed through the wall of a cemetery in central Delhi's Khan Market area Saturday morning and damaged around 10 graves, police said. Videos and pictures of the accident, widely circulated on social media, showed a major part of the bus inside the boundary of the cemetery. Police said the cluster bus was coming from Humayun Road and the driver lost control while taking a left turn and rammed the cemetery wall. They said it was going for duty from the Jawaharlal Nehru stadium to Karampura for route number 408 and at the time, there were only three people on board - the driver conductor and the marshal. The driver has been identified as Sanjay Kumar. A case under section 279 (rash driving) has been registered and further investigation was carried out, police said. Cluster buses are monitored and managed by the Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System Limited (DIMTS). Quoting the driver, a DIMTS official said around 6.36 am, while negotiating the roundabout near Hotel Taj Mann Sing after Khan Market, the bus crashed into the cemetery wall while attempting to avoid collision with a car coming from the right side at very high speed. The speed of the bus at that time was 30 kilometres per hour. Eugene Ratnam, secretary of the Delhi Cemeteries Committee, said the accident damaged 10-12 graves. ""There are two caretakers who live with their families inside the premises. They live on opposite sides of the cemetery. They heard a loud noise and saw the bus inside the cemetery after tearing down a portion of the wall. They immediately informed us about the incident,"" he said. ""Some families have come to check the damage to the graves,"" Mr Ratnam said, adding the committee will help clean the cemetery and repair the graves. Last month, a DTC bus hit a car before ramming into a subway crossing in west Delhi's Naraina area. Three people -- the driver, conductor and the marshal deployed on the bus -- were injured in that accident. Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com The bus was going towards the Naraina depot after dropping all the passengers at the stop. The driver later told the police that the braking system of the bus had failed.'''[/INST]

Ahmedabad: Two teenage girls miraculously escaped death when a speeding car hit their two-wheeler in Ahmedabad. The horrific accident was caught on CCTV cameras, but it took the police more than 12 hours to register a case and launch a hunt for the driver of the car. Engineering students Vekariya and Freni Pala were going towards a multiplex in western Ahmedabad on Tuesday afternoon when they were hit by a speeding Hyundai i-20. ""It's a miracle. When we saw the footage we were shocked. The car was moving at a high speed in the service lane,'' said Kalpesh Vekariya, father of one of the girls. The two girls are reported to be stable now. The car was owned by a businessman Alok Thakkar. But his relative Jayesh turned up at the Satellite police station, claiming the vehicle was being driven by an employee, Alkesh.

    '''Four friends travelling in a car drowned, while another occupant was missing after their vehicle coming from Rajasthan plunged into a lake near a village in Gujarat's Gandhinagar district, said police on Tuesday. All five were friends and returning from the adjoining state on Monday night after holidaying. While the bodies of the four men were fished out from the lake situated near Dashela village of Gandhinagar district on Tuesday evening, a search was on for the missing car occupant, said Kaizad Dastur, chief fire officer of the state capital. The village is situated near the Chiloda-Himmatnagar highway, and the five men, all in their late 20s, were coming towards the Naroda area of Ahmedabad, said Chiloda police inspector, AS Asari. Of these five, four hailed from Naroda, while one Gaurang Bhatt was a resident of Dashela village. They went to Rajasthan in a car a few days ago on a holiday trip. While returning on Monday night, they first went to Dashela to drop Bhatt. However, they all went incommunicado around 9 pm, and their relatives were also clueless about their whereabouts. Meanwhile, one of the relatives of a missing man learned that a mobile tower at Dashela had registered the latter's last cellphone location on Monday night before their phones went silent, said the inspector. Based on the information shared by the relative, a team of the Chiloda police reached Dashela on Tuesday afternoon and found three bodies floating in the lake, which was very close to an internal road, said AS Asari. It is possible the car driver, who was from Naroda, could not make a judgment during the night and drove his vehicle into the lake as the adjacent road was waterlogged due to rain. A person named Shailesh is still missing, and a search was on for him, said the police inspector. The car might have slipped into the lake when the driver was attempting to cross the waterlogged road during the night, said chief fire officer Dastur.'''[/INST]
